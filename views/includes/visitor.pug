    h1.text-center Hello Visitor!
    p
        | If you are reading this you are here as a simple visitor to the site.
    p
        | I decided to re-write the page so you can see how it works and by the way measure the time it took me
        | to do that. I started at May 22 23:00, paused at 1:30 to sleep, restarted at 7:30 and finished
        | at May 23 10:00
    p
        | You can't see nothing right now because you need to login to be able to see our videos.
    p
        | As I promised, you can use the account email: nobody@nowhere.com, password:password to see
        | what a regular user would see.
    p
        | I also enabled more accounts to show how the site can manage different types of users. for example
        | you can use a Teacher account (nowhere@nobody.com is an Student account) to see what your employees
        | or you users with a content generation permision would see. This account is email: teacher@company.com,
        | password:password2. Or you can use an Administrator account email: administrator@company.com, password:
        | password3.
    p
        | These are not the final pages of course, but they can show how the same addres can take your users
        | to different pages according to their account types.
